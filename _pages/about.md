Interests: theory of learning \ game theory \ optimisation \ quantum computing \ number theory \ going beyond pattern recognition towards abstraction & reasoning. ðŸ¤“

Background: pure mathematics & theoretical computer science. [Bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games, with applications to GANs & multi-agent RL. [Here](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) are a few papers published since then.
