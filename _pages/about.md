Background: pure mathematics. [Bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games, with applications to multi-agent learning (including GANs & RL). [Here](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) are a list of papers I was lucky to publish since then.
