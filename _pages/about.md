Currently: working at <a href='https://www.zurich.ibm.com/'>IBM Research Zurich</a>.

My [research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) focuses on learning & game theory, with applications to GANs & reinforcement learning. I'm also interested in moving beyond deep learning towards abstraction & reasoning.

Previously: MSc in Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science at the <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science'>University of Oxford</a>. I wrote my [bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and my [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games.
