Currently: working @ IBM Research Zurich.

Previously: MSc in Mathematics & Theoretical CS @ <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science'>University of Oxford</a>.

My [current research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) focuses on learning & game theory, with applications to GANs & reinforcement learning. Also interested in the increasingly pressing problem of [alignment](https://www.alignmentforum.org/) & [safety](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf), and going beyond deep learning towards [abstraction & reasoning](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC).

[Bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and my [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games.
