Currently working @ <a href='https://www.zurich.ibm.com/'>IBM Research Zurich</a>.

My [published research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) focuses on learning & game theory, with applications to GANs & multi-agent RL, but I'm equally interested in moving beyond deep learning towards abstraction & reasoning.

My background is in pure mathematics. I wrote my [bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and my [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games.
