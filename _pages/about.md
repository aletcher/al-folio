Working as a freelancer in [AI research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) and, occasionally, [contemporary dance](https://www.bodhiproject.at/dancers/). Current research focuses around game theory, optimisation, reinforcement learning and multi-agent learning, but I'm more generally interested in theoretical underpinnings of machine learning and going beyond curve-fitting to abstraction & reasoning. Side-kick interests include quantum computing, diagrammatic reasoning, number theory, and all things mathematical. ðŸ¤“

My background is in pure mathematics and computer science, with a [bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and a [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games (with applications to GANs and multi-agent RL). Here are the [papers](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) I published with lovely collaborators since then. Feel free to reach out!
