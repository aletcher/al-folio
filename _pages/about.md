Currently: PhD @ University of Oxford, supervised by [Jakob Foerster](https://foersterlab.com/).

<!-- Interests: mostly game theory & reinforcement learning in [past research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/), but increasingly interested in the ethically pressing problem of [AI safety & alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety), along with [abstraction & reasoning](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC). Also keen on a number of math problems like the [density of the EM sequence](https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2019/10/16/guess-again-the-ehrenfeucht-mycielski-sequence/), [integer sorting in linear time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200009891580X), and a few secret ones :-) -->

Previously: worked @ [IBM Research Zurich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com) after completing my [MSc in Mathematics & Theoretical CS](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science) @ University of Oxford.
