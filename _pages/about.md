Currently: working @ <a href='https://www.zurich.ibm.com'>IBM Research Zurich</a>.

Previously: MSc in Mathematics & Theoretical CS @ <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science'>University of Oxford</a>.

Most of my [published research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) focuses on game theory and reinforcement learning. But I am increasingly interested in the pressing problem of AI [alignment](https://www.alignmentforum.org/) & [safety](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf), as well as [abstraction & reasoning](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC).
