Working freelance in [AI research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) and, occasionally, [contemporary dance](https://www.bodhiproject.at/dancers/). Currently focusing on game theory / multi-agent learning, optimisation and RL, but I'm generally interested in theoretical underpinnings of ML and aiming to go beyond curve-fitting towards abstraction & reasoning. Sidekicks: quantum computing, diagrammatic reasoning, number theory, and all things mathematical. ðŸ¤“

My background is in pure mathematics and computer science, with a [bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and a [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games (with applications to GANs & multi-agent RL). Here are the [papers](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) I was lucky to publish with brilliant collaborators since then!
