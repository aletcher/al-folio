Currently freelancing between parallel careers in [academic research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) and [contemporary dance](https://www.bodhiproject.at/index.php/company/members).

I studied pure mathematics and computer science, writing my [bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in number theory and my [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games (with applications to GANs and multi-agent RL). Awarded best thesis in Oxford Computer Science. Here are a few [papers](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) I wrote since then.


Looking for collaborators and research internships before settling into a PhD or industry research position. Feel free to reach out!
